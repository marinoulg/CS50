# Hello World

Thanks to Professor Brian Kernighan (who taught CS50 when David took it!), “hello, world” has been implemented in hundreds of languages. Let’s add your implementation to the list!

In a file called ```hello.c```, in a folder called ```world```, implement a program in C that prints ```hello, world\n```, and that’s it!

## Correctness
Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using ```check50```, a command-line program that will output happy faces whenever your code passes CS50’s automated tests and sad faces whenever it doesn’t!

```

````

## Style
Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using ```style50```, a command-line program that will output additions (in green) and deletions (in red) that you should make to your program in order to improve its style. If you have trouble seeing those colors, ```style50``` supports other modes too!
```
style50 hello.c
```
